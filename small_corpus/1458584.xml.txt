Betty Loren-Maltese, the former town president of Cicero who was sentenced this month to eight years and one month in prison for her role in a $12 million municipal insurance scheme, has been ordered to begin serving her time two months early. Ms. Loren-Maltese, convicted of racketeering, wire fraud and mail fraud, was to begin serving her sentence on April 1. But after federal prosecutors raised concerns that she might gamble away money that the government hoped to confiscate, Judge John F. Grady of Federal District Court ordered that she turn herself in on Feb. 1. Prosecutors have said that in the last three years Ms. Loren-Maltese bet nearly $19 million at casinos, mostly in Las Vegas.
