Q. We hear about extinct species; what about emerging ones?

A. ''Identifying a new species as it emerges is the holy grail of evolutionary biology,'' said Dr. Rob DeSalle, an evolutionary biologist who is a curator at the American Museum of Natural History. For most scientists, making such an identification would depend on hard genetics.

''As things start to speciate,'' or split off into separate species, ''they may still look a lot alike, but genes that control the speciation event change, and finding these genes is like looking for a needle in a haystack,'' Dr. DeSalle explained. Any anatomical changes are often subtle and not related to the initial event, he said.

He emphasized distinguishing between the speciation process and its end product. For example, the African wild cat has a larger brain for its size than similar domesticated cats, a difference that appeared in just a few thousand years. Why this occurred is uncertain, but it probably persisted because wild cats were isolated from domestic cats and the change got fixed in one population, eliminated in the other.

''One school of thought would say the brain got smaller because of some changed need, and the other would say the change is the product of geographic isolation and not related to speciation of these cats at all,'' he said.

The test for separate species is to find fixed -- meaning inherited -- and different anatomical, behavioral or genetic characteristics that distinguish them.

''Species must be emerging someplace on earth,'' he said. ''The best places to look would be places with lots of species, like rain forests, and islands, because isolation opens new niches.''
