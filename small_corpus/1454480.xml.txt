Golf Ball Dimples

Q. How do the dimples on a golf ball aid its flight?

A. The round indentations on the ball's surface alter the pattern of turbulence in the air around it, creating little whirlpools of air that reduce drag.

According to the United States Golf Association, which maintains a research laboratory for golf equipment, a smooth ball will carry 120 yards while under similar launching conditions a dimpled ball will fly 260 yards.

Similarly, scientists have found that rougher stitches on a baseball encourage turbulent flow that lessens the drag caused by a lower-pressure wake behind the ball.

The complex effects of airflow on a golf ball are discussed in detail in ''The Physics of Golf,'' by Theodore P. Jorgensen (American Institute of Physics Press, 1993).

Energy lost in the turbulent wake of a golf ball causes drag, the book explains. The ball is also subject to some slowing from air actually touching the ball.

But with the addition of dimples, which cause even more turbulence, the turbulent area starts further back along the ball and is smaller, so it causes less drag.
