Q.  Will I burn more total calories running six miles than if I walked the same distance?

A.  By most calculations, you will use more calories running than walking, but there are many variables to be accounted for.

A calculator to estimate caloric expenditure for many everyday activities and exercises is available at www.internetfitness.com  /calculators/calburncalc.htm.

By that estimate, a 150-pound person who runs at six miles an hour for a full hour can expect to use 720 calories. Walking at four miles an hour for 90 minutes would use 486 calories.

The total used, and the proportion of fat calories to carbohydrate calories used, depend on the time spent exercising, the intensity and the underlying conditioning of your body. For example, exercising at a lower intensity burns more fat; harder effort burns a bigger share of carbohydrates.

And racewalking is in some cases more strenuous than running, because the racewalker actually has to make an effort to stay in an earthbound walk and not break into a loping run.

But the time you spend exercising will depend on how long you are willing to keep it up. So if you are more likely to take a long, moderately brisk walk than a short high-speed run, you may end up ahead of the game over the weeks and months with a lower level of intensity.
