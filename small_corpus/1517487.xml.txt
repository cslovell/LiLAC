POPULATION: 485

Meeting Your Neighbors

One Siren at a Time.

By Michael Perry.

HarperCollins, $24.95.

When he went home to New Auburn, Wis., and joined the volunteer fire and rescue service, Michael Perry acquired a new angle on the basics of emergency medical treatment. Sure, some of his patients were strangers, scooped from wrecks out on the highway that had helped turn New Auburn into a town that, like the family farms around it, had been ''pretty much kicked in the head.'' But many others were people he knew, people whose friends and families he'd run into at the Gas-N-Go or the softball tournament. And one of them would come from his own extended family. His account of what he's learned from seven years of burning barns and midnight medevacs shows his obvious affection for a rural Midwestern world where ''visiting with'' someone means hours of shooting the breeze and a ''supper club'' is the height of sophistication. Perry confesses that his loyalties are divided between ''the Gun Rack Crowd and the Pale and Tortured Contingent'' -- yielding a narrative style that jolts between nicely downplayed redneck realism (''We went there because a woman thought she was having a heart attack. I believe what she was having was her 17th beer'') and sensitivo posturing (''We find a trail leading back over the landscape of time, and we find ourselves bearing forward the remnants of a distant aesthetic not immediately evident in our detritus, but ours to claim, nonetheless''). Out at the farther extremities, too much potted history and banal philosophizing weaken its pulse, but ''Population: 485'' has a storytelling heart that won't quit.
