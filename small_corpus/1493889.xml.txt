Q. Why is it that when I bite into an apple, I get a very dry puckering feeling, almost as if I had ingested a small amount of alum?

A. Chemicals called tannins dry the mouth and pucker the lips when a person bites into certain varieties of apples. The sensation, which winemakers call astringency, is also produced by the various amounts of tannin in other fruits like grapes and in other foods like tea and rhubarb.

Tannins are substances that tan hides and make apples rust when exposed to the effects of the air. Tannins cover a range of chemicals called phenols, but only those called procyanidins are true tannins, which produce both tanning and puckering.

The amount of tannin in an apple, especially in the skin, differs not only from species to species, but also from tree to tree and even from year to year for the same tree.

A British system called Barker's classification describes cider apples based on their levels of acid (sour) and tannin (pucker). Apples with high acid (more than 0.45 percent) and low tannin (less than 0.2 percent) are called sharp. Those with high acid and high tannin are bittersharp. Those with low acid and high tannin are bittersweet, and those with both low acid and low tannin are sweet.

A sweet golden delicious apple might have only 0.06 percent tannin, while a bittersweet cider apple would by definition have more than 0.2 percent tannin.
