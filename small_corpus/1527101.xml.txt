Q. Why do you sometimes get a sudden feeling that you are falling as you drift off to sleep?

A. ''It is a kind of myclonic jerk, which means a sudden muscle contraction,'' said Dr. Neil B. Kavey, director of the Sleep Disorders Center at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. ''It is also called a sleep start, a hypnic jerk or a sleep jerk.''

''In a vast majority of cases,'' Dr. Kavey said, ''it is benign and seems to be a transition phenomenon as our nervous system switches from wakefulness, with high muscle tone and alert systems firing, to the relaxation that leads into sleep, with its decreased muscle tone.''

The jerk is just a little imperfection or stumble in the complex neurochemical process that leads to sleep, he said. ''Sometimes it does not go smoothly,'' he said. ''Perhaps something is out of balance or occurring too quickly, and the body corrects it with a jerk back into wakefulness.''

It has been suggested that such jerks are a holdover from human evolution, when humanoids might have slept in trees. Dr. Kavey said it could possibly be a protective mechanism.

''You only want to fall asleep once you get comfortable and safe,'' he said, ''and the jerk commonly occurs when people fall asleep at inopportune times. It may be your body's way of telling you, 'This not the place to fall asleep, not here in the conference; go home to bed.' ''

If it happens two or three times, it is no cause for alarm, but if it happens every time you fall asleep or if it disrupts sleep, it might be something to tell the doctor about, Dr. Kavey said.
