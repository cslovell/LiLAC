Q.  Why does crying make your eyes swell up?

A.  ''In order to bring more blood supply to the tear gland, the blood vessels respond to the nervous system by dilating,'' said Dr. Kip W. Dolphin, vice chairman of the department of ophthalmology and Bob Hope distinguished professor at Weill Medical College of Cornell University. ''This causes swelling in and around the eye area. Rubbing further distends the blood vessels, causing even more swelling.''

One main tear gland, called the lachrymal gland, at the upper outer quadrant of each eye, is responsible for emotional crying, Dr. Dolphin explained, while several additional areas produce secretions that keep the eye moist and comfortable. The increased blood flow helps the tear gland produce more tears, which are derived from the blood supply.

Tears are mainly water, Dr. Dolphin said, but also contain substances like secretory IgA, an antibody that fights infection; lysozyme, an enzyme that splits bacterial cell walls; lactoferrin, which binds up iron in the tear film; and salts, including sodium chloride, ordinary table salt; salts of potassium; and hydrogen bicarbonate, which helps makes tears less acidic.

Sometimes tearing stings more than at other times, Dr. Dolphin explained. If the eye is already irritated, increased tearing can further irritate nerve endings by making them lose more of their protective epithelial covering.
