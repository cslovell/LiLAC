Tree Sap in Winter

Q. Why don't the sap and other fluids in trees freeze during the winter?

A. Tree sap will freeze if it gets cold enough, but many winter-hardy trees and other woody plants prepare for the cold of winter by a series of steps collectively called acclimation.

In a process that is set off by the increasingly short and gradually colder days of fall and early winter, deciduous trees stop their growth and shed their leaves.

Meanwhile, more and more dissolved substances are concentrated in the sap within their living cells. These sugars, proteins, etc., lower the freezing point of the sap, acting much like antifreeze.

Water also migrates through the cell membranes to the spaces between the cells; there it can freeze and form the crystals that would kill a cell without doing any harm. The dehydration process helps increase the ''antifreeze'' concentration within the cells.

In a poorly understood adaptation, some particularly winter-hardy trees can keep the sap within their cells liquid at temperatures far below those at which it would normally turn to ice crystals, in some cases to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit; this is called supercooling or deep supercooling.
