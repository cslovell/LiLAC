More bodies were removed from ground zero yesterday as the gruesome recovery efforts continued in some of the final areas of the World Trade Center ruins to be searched. The effort to find remains has proven especially productive in the last three weeks, as Fire Department searchers mapped more than 700 new discoveries.

Starting a week after the attack, the Fire Department has recorded the location of human remains and other things. It first used a rough grid, and, since Sept. 30, more precise global positioning system equipment that is accurate to within a few yards.

''I think we'll learn a lot of things about what took place from analyzing this data,'' said Joseph Pfeifer, the battalion chief who was the first fire chief to report to the trade center on Sept. 11.

The maps show the progress of the search from October until yesterday. Bodies recovered just after the collapse were not mapped, and remains located using the original grid system are not included on these maps. The discoveries below may include small body parts. It is not a census of all the dead.

The maps show that discoveries in November and December were concentrated in the east and south parts of ground zero, in what was once the plaza, the south tower and the Marriott Hotel. In January, the search moved to the north tower, and in February to areas north and west.

In the last three weeks, hundreds of remains have been found in the south tower, especially its southeast corner.

Although more people died in the north tower, the first to be struck, equal numbers of remains have been found at the areas of the two buildings.

In all, 3,069 remains have been cataloged, and searchers classified about 600 as remains of firefighters or police officers based on bits of clothing or equipment.
