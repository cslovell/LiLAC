THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL

FOR MEN

By Alexander McCall Smith.

Pantheon, $19.95.

It will come as no surprise to admirers of Mma Ramotswe, the amply endowed founder of Botswana's No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, that the latest installment of her adventures has less to do with traditional sleuthing than with applying simple common sense to the complexities of human nature. The surprise is that one of the deluded souls in need of her attention is none other than Mma Makutsi, her seemingly sensible assistant, whose entrepreneurial instinct (taking over a church hall to teach office skills to semi-competent gentlemen) proves far stronger than her nose for romantic deception. Guest appearances are made by Cephas Buthelezi, pompous proprietor of a rival detective agency, and Mr. Molefelo, a very successful businessman whose near-fatal brush with ostrich rustlers causes him to appease his very guilty conscience. But, as always in Alexander McCall Smith's gentle celebrations of life in this arid patch of southern Africa, the best moments are the smallest: a ''miracle'' involving the hydraulic lift at Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, the garage owned by Mma Ramotswe's mild-mannered fianc√©, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni; the trouble his foster son, Puso, gets into with his slingshot; the confidences that are exchanged as Mma Ramotswe and an old friend sample ''the best jam in Botswana'' while sheltering from the midday sun. As always, Mma Ramotswe manages to reduce a variety of misdeeds ''to their natural proportions -- small, mean things that could be faced quite openly, sorted and folded away.''
