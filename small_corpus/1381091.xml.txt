Bill Richardson's path to the Democratic nomination for governor was cleared when the only other Democrat in the race, Gary King, withdrew to return to private law practice. That leaves Mr. Richardson, left, the former House member and energy secretary, to await the results of a June primary to determine which of four Republicans will oppose him. Gov. Gary Johnson, a Republican, is barred from running for a third term. Mr. King said he feared that continuing his candidacy would split the party.
