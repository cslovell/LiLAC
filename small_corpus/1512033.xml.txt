BLOCKS of refined red brick Federalist and Georgian mercantile buildings and dazzling centuries-old white mansions announce that Newburyport, now the smallest coastal city in Massachusetts, with just 17,000 residents, was once a much more prominent place. And so it was: a rival port to Boston, 40 miles to the south, in the 1700's and a cosmopolitan center of shipbuilding, commerce, craftsmanship and letters. Now, relieved of the burden of so much importance, it can afford to be easygoing and charming, reverent of its history while reveling in its salty side with public beaches, whale watching trips, lobster dinners and lots of fine bakeries.

Friday

5 p.m.  1. The Harbor Beckons  Take a stroll in Waterfront Park, with its period lighting and sweeping views of the Merrimack River merging with the Atlantic Ocean. This is the harbor where Newburyport was born, and the blocks of old buildings radiating out from it are now thick with art galleries, one-of-a-kind shops and cafes. Walk across Merrimac Street from the park to Market Square, a crescent of 200-year-old red brick buildings festooned with flowers. Browse in the Walsingham Gallery (47 Merrimac Street, 978-499-4411), a painting and sculpture gallery, or stop into Caffè di Siena (33 Pleasant Street, 978-462-3190) for a cappuccino ($2.25) and chocolate-covered biscotti ($2.50). At Brown Square, take in the architectural details of the Garrison Inn, built in 1809 and now named for the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. Continuing uphill, don't miss the fanciful white Clark Currier Inn, built in 1803, at 45 Green Street, or the stately Charles Bullfinch Superior Courthouse at Green and High Streets. Back down near the river, look for the gray granite Greek Revival Custom House Maritime Museum at 25 Water Street, built in 1835. Its collection includes antique boats, tools, art objects and historic photographs (978-462-8681, open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday and noon to 4 p.m. Sunday; admission $5 for adults).

8 p.m.  2. Dinner at Waterside  On the western end of the waterfront park, find the gray clapboard Black Cow Tap and Grill (54R Merrimac Street, 978-499-8873), a former bait shop expanded, renovated and now overlooking the harbor. Reserve a table on the outdoor deck in advance. After an appetizer of crunchy Maine crab cakes with beurre blanc ($9), try pan-seared scallops with saffron potato gnocchi, opal basil, tomatoes, spinach and garlic in white wine sauce ($23).

Saturday

9 a.m.  3. Breakfast and Bakery  Pastry lovers will quickly notice that Newburyport more than holds its own in one important category: it is blessed with an abundance of good bakeries. Walk to Greta's Great Grains Bakery and Cafe (24 Pleasant Street, 978-465-1709) and choose from the enticing Austrian pastries with Bavarian cream, fruit and, of course, chocolate ($1.50 to $2).

10 a.m.  4. Close to the Sea  Drive across the Plum Island Turnpike, a two-mile causeway linking downtown Newburyport to Plum Island with its majestic beach, salt marshes and abundant bird life. Five entities govern the island: Newburyport; Newbury; Ipswich; the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, which oversees the Parker River Wildlife Refuge; and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Management, which runs Sandy Point Reservation. Once on the island, head north through an agglomeration of tightly packed beach cottages, some of which offer parking in their yards for $8 a day, to the northern point, where there is public parking for $6 a day for swimmers and fishermen. Or, for a more serene setting, go south on Sunset Drive and, for a $5 fee, revel in the six miles of pristine sandy beach and sprawling marshes in the refuge and the reservation. There is limited parking in both. The only structures are towers and raised walkways for observing the birds that congregate in these marshes, especially during the spring and fall migrations, and make this one of the most renowned bird-watching spots in the East.

1 p.m.  5. Row Back in Time  Pick up a lobster salad sandwich ($6.95 or $12.95) to go at Molly's Pub (10 Center Street, 978-462-6652), and drive west on High Street, Route 113, past wonderful sea captains' mansions, to Lowell's Boat Shop in adjacent Amesbury (459 Main Street, Amesbury, 978-462-8681). At 210 years, Lowell's claims to be the oldest commercial dory shop in New England. ''Our paint shop has 150-year-old drops on the floor,'' Mike Brown, a senior boat builder, tells visitors. Opened in 1793, Lowell's designed a sturdy small craft for fishermen to row through Newburyport's rough waters and for schooner captains to launch from onboard when good fishing was found. Rent a skiff and follow the route the boat shop supervisor suggests. Row up the Merrimack River about half a mile along a shore that looks as if time had stood still, with shade trees, old houses and a brick mill building. Go ashore on a stony beach at Maudslay State Park, where a trail leads uphill, past a few meadows, to an exhilarating view of the ocean about six miles away. If you would rather actually be at sea, make a reservation to go out with Newburyport Whale Watch (54R Merrimac Street, 978-499-0832; www.newburyportwhalewatch.com) for four hours or more to stalk the whales with your camera. Adult fare is $29.

7 p.m.  6. Jazz by Candlelight  Walk a few blocks on streets lined with museum-quality houses in a panoply of historic styles to Joseph's Winter Street Cafe (24 Winter Street, 978-462-1188). It's a serene hideaway that serves fine New England food accompanied by live jazz. The veal medallions and lobster sautéed with Cognac and cream is full bodied, flavorful but not heavy ($29). Top off the meal with any creation by the pastry chef, Colleen Lefthes.

9 p.m.  7. Frivolity and Grog  Find live dance music and drinks a few blocks away at the Grog (13 Middle Street, 978-465-8008). With its thick wooden beams and high-backed booths, this tavern looks much as it did in the 1860's when it opened as Alfred W. Thompson's Ladies and Gents Eating and Oyster House.

Sunday

9 a.m.  8. Go Continental  Enjoy the informality of eating in a friend's oversize kitchen at Middle Street Foods (25 Middle Street, 978-462-6323). Fast and friendly, this restaurant specializes in home-baked quiche, breads and pastry served à la carte or as a Continental breakfast ($4.95 to $6.95).

10 a.m.  9. Colonial Manor  It takes a lot of provender to keep a busy port town going, and the Spencer-Peirce-Little Farm -- overlooking the mouth of the Merrimack River less than a mile from the Newburyport town line -- once raised cattle and crops like apples, pears and salt marsh hay. Daniel Peirce, who built it around 1690, had pretensions of nobility. He used brick from England and local stone to construct a manor house with a grand allée, originally of elms and now of sugar maples. ''The house is bizarre for its time but we had our characters up here,'' said Bethany Graff, who manages the property for its owner, the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities. The grounds are open all year and house tours are given through Oct. 15 (5 Little's Lane, Newbury; 978-462-2634; www.spnea.org).

THE BASICS  Visiting Newburyport

The Clark Currier Inn (45 Green Street, 978-465-8363), an elegant 1803 ship captain's house, is centrally located and furnished with charming antiques. Its eight rooms are $125 to $185. Continental breakfast and afternoon tea are included.

The Garrison Inn (11 Brown Square, 978-499-8500) is a decidedly urbane historic landmark. Its 24 spare but elegant rooms are $130 to $210 and include a Continental breakfast.

The Windsor House Inn (38 Federal Street, 978-462-3778) is an 18th-century residence and ship's chandlery. Each of its four rooms is $155. A two-course English breakfast and afternoon tea are included.

JOURNEYS  Correction:  August 22, 2003, Friday  The 36 Hours column last Friday, about Newburyport, Mass., misspelled the name of a prominent building. It is the Charles Bulfinch Superior Courthouse, not Bullfinch.
