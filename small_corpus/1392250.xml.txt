A former Roman Catholic priest, who most recently was a Protestant pastor of a gay and lesbian church in Rapid City, has resigned after reports that he had been convicted of molesting a 15-year-old boy in a Catholic parish in Kansas 13 years ago. Church officials said the pastor, the Rev. James A. Forsythe, had resigned, saying that he had been fired from two secular jobs since it was reported that he had failed to register as a sex offender and that he could no longer afford to be a pastor.
