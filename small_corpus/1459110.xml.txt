ON a snowy day in Grafton, fires are stoked and soft chairs beckon in a cozy country inn. Nearby, snow enthusiasts strap on snowshoes and cross-country skis. On Main Street, women in pleated wool slacks and men in heavy boots quickly drop their taciturn veneer for a visitor who asks a question or starts a friendly conversation. Grafton is a town of 600, smaller than it was in a long-ago heyday of mills, quarries and sheep farms. But largely thanks to the Windham Foundation, which is based in Grafton and has preserved dozens of its lovely old buildings, the town, set in an alpine valley, still looks like a Currier & Ives print. On a leisurely weekend, it is a pleasant place for discovering winter's quiet side.

Friday

5 p.m.  1. A Walk at Dusk  In the remaining sliver of daylight, amble through town to get oriented. From Grafton's major intersection, Main Street and Townshend Road, turn west onto Main and walk one long block to a fork in the road. Bear left onto Hinkley Brook Road to find the well-marked Village Park, 50 acres of trails and thick groves of hemlock, birch and beech. Sit for a spell on the bench near the entrance or at a picnic table at the top of the hill to gaze at the first stars, listen to the night sounds and unwind.

7 p.m.  2. Feast at the Tavern  In 1867 Ulysses S. Grant, on a New England trip before he ran for president, stayed at the Old Tavern at Grafton (92 Main Street, 800-843-1801), and it was already an old tavern then. It has been in continuous operation since 1801 as an inn and dining place, catering at first to passengers traveling by stagecoach between Boston and Montreal. Show up early to explore the dining room, pub and sitting rooms, and admire the antique furniture. Find a spot near a fireplace to enjoy a cocktail and conversation or read a newspaper. For dinner, try mussels in prosciutto cream sauce with pesto croutons ($8) followed by Beaujolais-braised lamb shank with celeriac mashed potatoes, root vegetables, rosemary and lamb demi-glace ($27). Finish with tiramis√π ($6.50). After dinner, the attached pub is the place for a hot toddy and some live fiddle or piano music. If asked to sing, just shout out. Guests aren't required to carry a tune.

Saturday

9 a.m.  3. Coffee and History  Join the locals starting the day at the 161-year-old Grafton Village Store (162 Main Street, 802-843-2348). Pick up a pastry and coffee and munch at a picnic table, or keep your parka on and sit outside on the front porch. Look over the store's stock of hand-knitted sweaters, quilts, and Vermont maple syrup and jams, and browse for reading material in the book swap box. In one corner, find the Old Palmer Cash Store display, with weathered oak showcases, Boston Krakajak Coffee crates and a bulky metal safe. For a more comprehensive look at Grafton's history, cross the street and drop by the Grafton Historical Society Museum (147 Main Street, 802-843-2584). The friendly curator is Elisha Prouty, a retired textile designer who, true to his Yankee name, is a born and bred Vermonter. ''The joke is, 'I'm real, go ahead, touch me,' '' he said. Mr. Prouty will show you old photos and antique tools, furniture and clothing. The building itself, from 1840, is a fine example of plank construction, in which two-by-fours are piled horizontally one atop the other for a costly but well-insulated structure. (Open by appointment; 802-843-1010 in advance. The suggested donation is $3 for adults.)

10 a.m.  4. Yes, There's a Covered Bridge  Continue up Main Street past the White Church, built in 1858, and the Brick Church, built in 1833; both are still active as interdenominational Protestant churches. Bear right onto Middletown Road and turn right onto Cemetery Road to see a burial ground with slate headstones marking the graves of early settlers and Revolutionary War veterans. Back on Townshend Road pass the heated outdoor tennis courts (open to all, even in winter) and turn onto Pleasant Street for the Rusty Moose Gallery (802-843-1151), which features metal sculpture. Take a right at Kidder Hill Road to find the Kidder Hill covered bridge, built around 1869. On Townshend Road again, pop into Gallery North Star (151 Townshend Road, 802-843-2465), have a look at the sheep farming exhibit (with real sheep) in a barn behind the Windham Foundation building (225 Townshend Road), and watch Cheddar-making at the Grafton Village Cheese Company (533 Townshend Road, 800-472-3866).

11:30 a.m.  5. Nature and a Bowl of Soup  Before lunch, take a quick peek at dioramas and interactive exhibits at the Nature Museum (186 Townshend Road, 802-843-2111), which concentrates on the flora and fauna native to New England. You will also find good maps and self-guided tour brochures for the village and nearby area. (Admission: adults $3, children $1. Open Saturday and Sunday and by appointment, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; www.nature-museum.org.) Then head to the Daniels House (802-843-2255) -- its main building dates from 1820 -- at 56 Townshend Road, next to the Old Tavern. This bright but Spartan self-serve cafe has homemade soups ($4.50), sandwiches ($6.75) and melt-in-your-mouth pastries ($3.75). There are also a pretty standard gift shop and a good information center with maps, guides and local weekly newspapers.

1 p.m.  6. Go Play in the Snow  Surrender to the pull of the mountain scenery and crisp, rejuvenating air with an active afternoon at the Grafton Ponds Nordic Ski and Mountain Bike Center (783 Townshend Road, 802-843-2400). A snow-making system guarantees good conditions all winter for cross-country skiing or snow tubing down a 600-foot run. There are also snowshoeing over miles of trails and ice skating on natural ponds. Equipment for any of these activities can be rented at the center's office in an immaculate log cabin. And when you need a break, you can head back to the cabin for a hot chocolate or some chili. (Open daily 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.; trail fee: adults $16, half-day $12; children $6.)

6 p.m.  7. Dinner in Chester  Take the car and head out Route 35 North for seven bucolic miles to Chester, a larger town with ample shopping and restaurants. On the Town Green is Raspberries and Tyme (90 On the Green, 802-875-4486), where you can count on a creative menu and a casual meal. Start with Danish baby Brie cheese, baked and topped with fresh strawberry Grand Marnier sauce and toasted walnuts ($7.95) or wild mushroom soup laced with Madeira wine and white truffle oil ($5). For your entree, try filet mignon wrapped in Vermont smoked bacon with an eight-ounce grilled lobster tail ($27.95) or Wiener schnitzel with Austrian mushroom sauce, sour cream and dill ($19.95). Dessert is decidedly dangerous, with selections like raspberry whipped cream truffle cake filled with chocolate ganache ($4.50).

8 p.m.  8. Hang Out With the Ski Crowd  From the Chester Town Green, take Route 11 West about a mile to the Stone Hearth Inn (802-875-2525), below, a refurbished farmhouse built in 1810 overlooking the Williams River. With its wooden wainscoting bar and a recreation room outfitted with a fireplace, board games and a pool table, the inn is a meeting place for snowmobilers and for skiers who have spent the day at nearby slopes. The inn is rustic but alluring, as Christopher Clay, the owner, learned two years ago when he found it while on vacation from his home in Minnesota. ''A trip to New England became an inn-buying experience,'' he said.

Sunday

11:30 a.m.  9. The Place for Brunch  Savor a last taste of rural Vermont before you get back on the Interstate for your trip home. About five miles from Grafton on Route 121, on the way east to I-91, stop for brunch at the Inn at Saxtons River (27 Main Street in Saxtons River, 802-869-2110). The brunch buffet ($12.95) includes a choice of eggs Benedict or omelet of the day, along with pancakes and maple syrup, meats and salads, and what Judi Gunnip, the assistant manager, calls ''a mean mimosa.''

THE BASICS  Visiting Grafton

Grafton is 230 miles or about four hours north of New York City, 14 miles west of the Bellows Falls exit off Interstate 91. An Amtrak station is at Bellows Falls. The closest major airport is at Hartford, about an hour and a half away.

The Inn at Woodchuck Hill Farm (347 Woodchuck Hill Road; 802-843-2398), a 1790's farmhouse about two miles from town, has 11 rooms and suites from $89 to $155. A full breakfast is included.

The Farmhouse 'Round the Bend (372 Route 121 East; 802-843-1085) has three simple rooms in an 1840's house for $75 to $85. A Continental breakfast is included.
